#**Minimum Viable Product**

Oatnr is a web app inspired by Tumblr built using Ruby on Rails and JS with React and Redux. By W9D5, I will have successfully implemented the following features with smooth navigation, no bugs, a plethora of seed data and awesome CSS styling (this was heavily appropriated from the sample):

- [ x ] Hosting on Heroku
- [ x ] New account, login, and guest/demo login
- [ ] Posts form for various post types
- [ ] Feed/dashboard
- [ ] Follows
- [ ] Likes
- [ ] **BONUS** Reblog (think about doing recursion)
- [ ] **BONUS** User show pages
- [ ] **BONUS** Infinite scroll on dashboard
- [ ] **BONUS** account settings
- [ ] **BONUS** tags
more if there's time:
- [ ] Explore
- [ ] Blog suggestions
