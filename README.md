PERFECT, SO JUST START WITH WHAT YOU HAVE AND EDIT -->

#**Minimum Viable Product**

Oatnr is a web app inspired by Tumblr built using Ruby on Rails and JS with React and Redux. By W9D5, I will have successfully implemented the following features with smooth navigation, no bugs, a plethora of seed data and awesome CSS styling (this was heavily appropriated from the sample):

-[] Hosting on Heroku
-[] New account, login, and guest/demo login
-[] Posts form for various post types
-[] Feed/dashboard
-[] Follows
-[] likes
-[] **BONUS** Reblog (think about doing recursion)
-[] **BONUS** User show pages
-[] **BONUS** Infinite scroll on dashboard
-[] **BONUS** account settings
-[] **BONUS** tags
more if there's time:
-[] explore
-[] blog suggestions
